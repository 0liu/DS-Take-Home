That is, if I go to company XYZ site and look for hotels in NY and SF within the same session, the corresponding JSON row will show my user id, some basic info about me and the two cities.\n",

    "* For each city, find the most likely city to be also searched for within the same session.\n",
    "* Travel sites are browsed by two kinds of users. Users who are actually planning a trip and users who just dream about a vacation. The first ones have obviously a much higher purchasing intent. Users planning a trip often search for cities close to each other, while users who search for cities far away from each other are often just dreaming about a vacation. That is, a user searching for LA, SF and Las Vegas in the same session is much more likely to book a hotel than a user searching for NY, Paris, Kuala Lumpur (makes sense, right?). Based on this idea, come up with an algorithm that clusters sessions into two groups: high intent and low intent. Explain all assumptions you make along the way."
