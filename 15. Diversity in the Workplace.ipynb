    "# Description\n",
    "There has been lots of talking about diversity in the workplace, especially in technology. The Head of HR at your company is very concerned about that and has asked you to analyze internal data about employees and see whether results suggest that the company is treating its employees fairly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, she gave you the following tasks:\n",
    "* In the company there are 6 levels (described below). Identify, for each employee, her corresponding level.\n",
    "    - Individual Contributors (IC) - they don't manage anyone \n",
    "    - Middle Managers (MM) - they are the direct bosses of IC \n",
    "    - Directors (D) - they are the direct bosses of MM\n",
    "    - VP - D direct bosses\n",
    "    - Executives (E) - VP direct bosses\n",
    "    - CEO - The direct boss of E.\n",
    "* How many people each employee manages? You should have a table with employee ids and the number of people managed. Consider that if John directly manages 2 people and these two people manage 5 people each, then we conclude that John manages 12 people.\n",
    "* Build a model to predict the salary of each employee.\n",
    "* Describe the main factors impacting employee salaries. Do you think the company has been treating its employees fairly? Do you see any bias? What are the next steps you would suggest to the Head of HR?"
