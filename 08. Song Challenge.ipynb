    "# Description\n",
    "You are the fifth employee at company XYZ. The good news is that if the company becomes big, you will become very rich with the stocks. The bad news is that, at such an early stage, the data is usually very messy. All their data is stored in json files.\n",

    "* What are the top 3 and the bottom 3 states in terms of number of users?\n",
    "* What are the top 3 and the bottom 3 states in terms of user engagement? You can choose how to mathematically define user engagement. What the CEO cares about here is in which states users are using the product a lot/very little.\n",
    "* The CEO wants to send a gift to the first user who signed-up for each state. That is, the first user who signed-up from California, from Oregon, etc. Can you give him a list of those users?\n",
    "* Build a function that takes as an input any of the songs in the data and returns the most likely song to be listened next. That is, if, for instance, a user is currently listening to \"Eight Days A Week\", which song has the highest probability of being played right after it by the same user? This is going to be v1 of a song recommendation model.\n",
    "* How would you set up a test to check whether your model works well and is improving engagement?"
