    "A data scientist has built a model to suggest 5 people to each user. These potential friends will be shown on the user newsfeed. At first, the model is tested just on a random subset of users to see how it performs compared to the newsfeed without the new feature.\n",

    "* Is the test winning? That is, should 100% of the users see the Recommended Friends feature?\n",
    "* Is the test performing similarly for all user segments or are there differences among different segments?\n",
    "* If you identified segments that responded differently to the test, can you guess the reason? Would this change your point 1 conclusions?"
