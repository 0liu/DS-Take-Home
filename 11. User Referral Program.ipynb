    "The program has been running for almost a month and the Growth Product Manager wants to know if it's been successful. She is very excited cause, since the referral program started, the company saw a spike in number of users and wants you to be able to give her some data she can show to her boss.\n",

It simply started on a given day for all users and you are drawing conclusions by looking at the data before and after the test started. What kinds of risks this approach presents? Can you think of a better way to test the referral program and measure its impact?"
